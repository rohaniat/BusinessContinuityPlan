# Business Continuity Plan for Spendology Solutions

This repository contains a Business Continuity Plan (BCP) designed for Spendology Solutions to ensure operational resilience during and after a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. The BCP outlines processes for mitigating service disruptions, maintaining critical functions, and recovering from incidents to protect both SpendSmart's infrastructure and customer trust.

## Files in this Repository

- **Business_Continuity_Plan.pdf**: A comprehensive document detailing response strategies for DDoS attacks, covering prevention, mitigation, and recovery steps.

## Project Overview

### Purpose & Scope

The purpose of this BCP is to provide structured response procedures for DDoS incidents, ensuring that the SpendSmart application remains accessible and operational. This plan focuses on minimizing the impact of DDoS attacks and maintaining service continuity for both the application and underlying infrastructure.

### Key Components

1. **Concept of Operations**
   - **Prevention**: Monitor traffic and analyze patterns to detect potential attacks early.
   - **Mitigation**: Apply traffic filtering, rate-limiting, and collaborate with ISPs to deflect malicious traffic.
   - **Recovery**: Gradually restore service while ensuring minimal disruption.

2. **Roles and Responsibilities**
   - **IT Security**: Monitors traffic, initiates mitigation, and manages recovery.
   - **Communications Team**: Coordinates internal and customer notifications.
   - **CISO**: Acts as incident commander, ensuring cohesive response efforts.

3. **Activation and Notification**
   - **Criteria**: Alert systems detect unusual traffic spikes or service outages.
   - **Procedure**: IT Security is notified to investigate and begin mitigation protocols.

4. **Incident Handling Process**
   - **Detection**: Regular monitoring of logs and alerts to spot anomalies.
   - **Containment**: Isolate affected services and apply traffic filtering.
   - **Eradication**: Remove malicious traffic sources through collaboration with third-party providers.
   - **Recovery**: Utilize backup services and scale systems to handle increased traffic load.

5. **Recovery and Reconstitution**
   - **Validation**: Conduct data and functionality testing post-recovery.
   - **Notification**: Notify customers once services are fully restored.
   - **Post-Incident Review**: Document the incident timeline, actions taken, and improvements for future response.

### Appendices

- **Appendix A**: Contact Information for key stakeholders, ISPs, and cloud DDoS providers.
- **Appendix B**: Traffic Analysis Tools such as Wireshark and AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and analysis.
- **Appendix C**: Escalation procedures, including criteria and steps for involving external DDoS mitigation services.
- **Appendix D**: Communication templates for notifying internal teams and customers.

## Summary

The BCP for Spendology Solutions outlines a comprehensive approach to maintaining continuity and reducing the impact of DDoS attacks. Regular testing, proactive monitoring, and clear communication protocols ensure that SpendSmart remains resilient and reliable in the face of cyber threats.
